;;; Commentary:

;; Description:
;;
;; `annot.el' is a general (and scalable) annotation manager that works on GNU
;; Emacs.  It lets you add/edit/remove annotations, highlights, or even
;; annotated images on any file and manages them for you.  All annotations are
;; stored separately for each annotated file and get reproduced when the file is
;; opened again. You can even store annotations on non-editable files.  Because
;; annot keeps track of md5 checksums of annotated files, annotations won't
;; disappear even when file names are changed.
;; 
;; Requirement:
;; 
;; GNU Emacs 23 or higher.
;; 
;; Installation:
;;
;; Insert the following line to your .emacs:
;;
;;  (require 'annot)
;; 
;; Keybindings:
;;
;; * [C-x C-a] - Add a new annotation
;;               Highlight the current region if any (annot-edit/add)
;; * [C-x C-r] - Remove the annotation/highlight at point (annot-remove)
;; * [C-x C-i] - Insert a new image at point (annot-add-image)
;;
;; User Commands:
;; 
;; * `annot-edit/add'   - Add a new annotation or highlight if a region is
;;                        specified.  Edit an annotation if there's one already.
;; * `annot-remove'     - Remove the annotation/highlight at point.
;; * `annot-add-image'  - Insert an image at point.
;; * `annot-convert'    - Convert text within the active region into an
;;                        annot text annotation
;; * `annot-to-comment' - Convert a text annotation at point to a comment
;; * `annot-goto-next'  - Go to the next annot overlay
;; * `annot-goto-previous' - Go to the previous annot overlay
